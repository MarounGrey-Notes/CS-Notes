# Motivation
###### (should I write a supportive motivational bot for lonely people? Lmao would be cool)
* Dont be hard on yourself. It’s not your fault always. Sometimes, you are not that much ready as you’re expected. 
* You don't have to takeeverything so seriously - especially in things you cant control. You cant control other people. 

# How to be a better employee
#### Be more visible:
* Keep a daily log of your activities - send this log as a weekly report to your manager.
* Offer to give presentations or trainings - pick a topic that would be useful to your team.
* Speak up -do this at the meetings and any time you get a chance.
* Be seen - set up regular meetings with your boss. Make sure you are seen often.
*One of the first things I did whenever I started a new job was to start keeping a daily account of where I spent my time and what I accomplished during the day. I'd then take that information and compile a weekly summary every Friday to send to my manager I called this my "weekly report," and when I'd send out my first report at each new job, I'd include some information to let my manager know that I understand how important it is to know what your direct reports are doing, and so i was sending a weekly summary of my activities to make his or her job easier.*
