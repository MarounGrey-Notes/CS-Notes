# Motivation
###### (should I write a supportive motivational bot for lonely people? Lmao would be cool)
* Dont be hard on yourself. It’s not your fault always. Sometimes, you are not that much ready as you’re expected. 
* You don't have to take everything so seriously - especially in things you cant control. You cant control other people. 

# How to be a better employee
#### Be more visible:
* Keep a daily log of your activities - send this log as a weekly report to your manager.
* Offer to give presentations or trainings - pick a topic that would be useful to your team.
* Speak up -do this at the meetings and any time you get a chance.
* Be seen - set up regular meetings with your boss. Make sure you are seen often.
*"One of the first things I did whenever I started a new job was to start keeping a daily account of where I spent my time and what I accomplished during the day. I'd then take that information and compile a weekly summary every Friday to send to my manager I called this my "weekly report," and when I'd send out my first report at each new job, I'd include some information to let my manager know that I understand how important it is to know what your direct reports are doing, and so i was sending a weekly summary of my activities to make his or her job easier." - Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual*

* Most of the people stop at the first "No". Don't be that kind of person. Instead, be the kind of person who has to be beaten off with the stick - and even then, still comes back.
* The 20% you need to know to be 80% percent efficient using it.
* It's easy to fall into the trap of talking about yourself and trying to demonstrate why you're worthy, but you'll find much more success in solving other people's problems and genuinely being helpful.
* Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
* The more emotionally attached we are to someone the easier it is for us to be convinced of their value and virtue in the pesence of recent information that only reinforces good stuff.
