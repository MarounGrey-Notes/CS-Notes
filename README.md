# Notes Repository
This repository contains my personal notes on various topics related to programming, computer science, and mathematics. I use this repository to keep track of useful resources, such as books, courses, and websites, as well as to take notes on various concepts to better understand them.

## # Contents
The repository is organized into directories based on the different topics that I'm interested in. Each directory contains subdirectories for specific subtopics, as well as notes and resources related to those subtopics. The main topics that I'm currently focusing on are:

* Programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java)
* Computer science concepts (e.g., algorithms, data structures, databases)
* Mathematics (e.g., calculus, linear algebra, statistics)

### Notes
The notes in this repository are intended to be a personal reference for myself, but I'm sharing them publicly in case they're useful to others. Please keep in mind that these notes are a work in progress, and I'm constantly updating them as I learn new things.

### Resources
I've also included a list of resources that I've found useful in my learning journey. This includes books, online courses, and websites that I've used to learn various concepts. If you're new to programming, computer science, or mathematics, these resources might be a good place to start.

### Contributing
If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improving the notes or resources, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to improve my understanding and knowledge, and I welcome any feedback or contributions.
